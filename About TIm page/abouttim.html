                <h2>Tim "Avicii" Bergling</h2>
                <p><b>Tim Bergling</b> better known by his stage name <b>Avicii</b> was a Swedish DJ, remixer, record producer, musician, 
                    and songwriter who specialized in audio programming, remixing, and record producing.
                </p> 
                <p>At the age of 16, Bergling began posting his remixes on electronic music forums, which led to his first record deal. 
                    He rose to prominence in 2011 with his single "Levels". His debut studio album, True (2013), blended electronic 
                    music with elements of multiple genres and received generally positive reviews. It peaked in the top ten in more 
                    than fifteen countries and topped international dance charts; the lead single, "Wake Me Up", topped most music markets
                     in Europe and reached number four in the United States.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    In 2015, Bergling released his second studio album, Stories, and in 2017 he released an EP, Avīci (01). 
                    His catalog also included the singles "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero, "You Make Me", "X You", 
                    "Hey Brother", "Addicted to You", "The Days", "The Nights", "Waiting for Love", "Without You" and 
                    "Lonely Together". Bergling was nominated for a Grammy Award for his work on "Sunshine" with David Guetta in 2012 
                    and "Levels" in 2013. Several music publications credit Bergling as among the DJs who ushered electronic music 
                    into Top 40 radio in the early 2010s. Bergling retired from touring in 2016 due to health problems, having 
                    suffered from stress and poor mental health for several years. On 20 April 2018, he died by suicide in Muscat, Oman. 
                    He was buried on 8 June at Hedvig Eleonora Church in his hometown. His posthumous third album titled Tim was released in 2019.

                <h2>1989–2010: Early life and career</h2>

                <p>
                    Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989, the son of Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén. 
                    He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight. He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, 
                    and Anton Körberg. Inspired by his brother, who was also a DJ, he began making music at the age of 16. 
                    In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label. He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, 
                    where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct deep house style. By 2009 to 2010, 
                    Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. His remixes during this period 
                    were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu" and "Even". Bergling explained that the name <i>Avicii</i>  means "the lowest 
                    level of Buddhist hell" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already used upon creating his 
                    Myspace page. Then, in 2010, Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in 
                    several countries, including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden. He also remixed 
                    Nadia Ali's classic single "Rapture" for her album <i>Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition</i>. In October 2010, 
                    Bergling signed with the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.

                    2011–2013: "Levels"
                </h2>

                <p>
                    In 2011, Bergling released "Levels", which launched him into the mainstream. "Levels" reached the top ten in Austria,
                    Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United
                    Kingdom, whilst topping the charts in Hungary, Norway and Sweden.

                    On 29 December 2012,Bergling released "I Could Be the One" with Nicky Romero. After first being debuted at his shows 
                    almost a year earlier, the track finally got released via Bergling's record label LEVELS. The new vocal version was 
                    released along with an instrumental version, a radio edit, and remixes from Audrio and Didrick. On 9 January 2013, 
                    Bergling launched the Avicii X You project, a partnership with Ericsson designed to create the world's first 
                    "crowdsourced" hit song. The project enabled fans to send in basslines, effects, melodies, rhythms and vocals to 
                    Bergling as sound files over the Internet.[51] The song features sequences from Kian Sang (melody), Naxsy (bassline), 
                    Martin Kupilas, Jonathan Madray, Mateusz Kolata, and Christian Westphalen (effects). Bergling acted as executive 
                    producer and created the finished song officially titled X You, which was released on 26 February 2013. 
                    On 30 January 2013, Bergling released "Three Million" featuring Negin to celebrate three million fans on his 
                    Facebook page. Bergling was nominated for a Grammy for Best Dance Recording with "Levels" at the 2013 Grammy Awards.

                    experimental in nature. For example, Bergling brought out a stomping band to play through the new bluegrass-tinged 
                    song "Wake Me Up". Many of these new songs received mixed critical reviews after the concert.

                    On 10 August 2017, Bergling released the six-track EP <i>Avīci (01)</i>. Bergling said of the release: "I'm really 
                    excited to be back with music once again. It has been a long time since I released anything and a long time since 
                    I was this excited over new music! My focus on this first EP of the album was to get a mix of new and old songs: 
                    some that fans have been asking about and waiting for mixed with brand new songs that they haven't heard before!"

                    early version of "No Pleasing A Woman". The latter was also sung by Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong. 
                    In December, two singles were released on the networks, "Alive" with Wyclef Jean and "Lethal Drug" with 
                    Chris Martin of Coldplay. "Fades Away" featuring MishCatt was also released in December after being performed 
                    in Stockholm at the Avicii Tribute Concert for Mental Health.

                    In January 2012, Bergling was hospitalized for 11 days in New York City with acute pancreatitis caused by excessive 
                    alcohol use. In 2014, Bergling underwent surgery and had both his appendix and gallbladder removed. In 2016, 
                    Bergling's health deteriorated, and he retired from performing live. In the 2017 documentary Avicii: True Stories, 
                    directed by his close and longtime collaborator Levan Tsikurishvili, Bergling spoke about his physical and mental 
                    health struggles. The documentary depicts the pressure from his management to continue performing live in spite 
                    of his objections.

                    High pressure from management and fans to continue touring and maintaining his public persona were cited as key 
                    reasons for his suicide, according to GQ. In a statement from the article, "Bergling feared upsetting fans. 
                    He was sensitive to the 'flood of hate mail' after cancelled gigs." His manager, Ash Pournouri, admitted that 
                    he knew of Bergling's health problems but refused to label them mental health problems. Furthermore, his management 
                    team only became aware of his painkiller addiction in November 2014. They staged two interventions for him, 
                    neither of which were successful. Pournouri rescheduled many shows in order for Bergling to recover in Stockholm. 
                    Having discovered his client's alcohol issues earlier, Pournouri set out to forbid his promoters from offering 
                    him alcohol, clearing out his minibar and focusing on his recovery. Problems worsened, however, when there were 
                    no crew to "keep tabs" on Bergling during his recuperation. Against his client's wishes, Pournouri claimed to 
                    have cancelled two more world tours, which would have added up to approximately US$2.9 million in profits.

                    On 1 May, TMZ reported that the cause of death was a suicide due to self-inflicted injuries with a broken wine bottle, 
                    with Bergling eventually dying of blood loss. On 22 May, Bergling's family announced plans for a private funeral 
                    with "the people who were closest to him". A funeral service was held on 8 June at the Skogskyrkogården cemetery in 
                    Stockholm. He was buried at Hedvig Eleonora Church in June 2018.

                    Avicii inspired many artists in the EDM genre, many of whom paid tribute to him after his death. Artists like 
                    Norwegian DJ Kygo, Alan Walker and DubVision described him as an "icon" in EDM. Other artists such as Diplo, 
                    Sebastian Ingrosso, Felix Jaehn, and Martin Garrix, the last of whom collaborated with Avicii on his 2015 single 
                    "Waiting for Love", have also cited him as a source of inspiration, with the songs "Levels" and "Seek Bromance" 
                    being specifically mentioned as points of inspiration.

                    On the day of his death, The Washington Post wrote an article citing Avicii as a pioneer artist in the attempt 
                    to bridge the gap between country and electronic music, crediting his 2013 hits "Wake Me Up" and "Hey Brother" 
                    as a good example of this movement. Avicii is also credited for influencing other attempts at continuing 
                    this genre crossover, including songs such as Zedd's "The Middle" and Hailee Steinfeld's "Let Me Go".

                    Avicii also influenced a number of mainstream artists outside electronic music. Nile Rodgers said that in 
                    terms of melody writing, Avicii was "maybe one of the best, if not the best I’ve ever worked with." 
                    Charlie Puth said that Avicii was "The man who really opened my eyes as to what my productions could one day 
                    sound like."
